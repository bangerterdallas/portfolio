Requirement Specs
    Prompt the user for the number of players. This does not include the dealer. You may have 1 - 5 players
    Each player starts with $100 in their account
    A player can continue until they are out of money
    Each round
    Prompt each player one at a time for their bet amount.
    Display the current balance for each user as part of their prompt
    The minimum bet is $5 or their entire balance, whichever is lower
    Deal the cards
    Each round will have a fresh deck of shuffled cards
    Cards are dealt one at a time beginning with player 1 and ending with the dealer
    Each player (including the dealer) gets two cards, meaning there will be two cycles of dealing cards to each player.
    After dealing all cards display the dealer's second card
    For each player starting with player 1
    Show the player hand
    Ask the player if they'd hit (take another card) or hold
    Repeat until they hold or bust (total of cards is over 21)
    If they bust they lose
    If the player holds then the next player goes
    After all players are done the dealer complete its turn
    Display both dealer cards (print each on a new line)
    Use time.sleep() to wait for 1 second before dealing another card(s) to the dealer
    The dealer must take a card until its total is 17 or higher
    If the dealer's initial hand is 17 or higher it does not take a card
    Use appropriate messages so the players know what the dealer is doing
    Ex: "The dealer takes a card" / "The dealer busts" / "The dealer holds"
    Determining winners
    If the dealer busts (goes over 21), all players who did not bust win
    If the player and dealer totals are the same they tie
    If the players hand is lower than the dealer, the player loses
    Use appropriate messages to let each player know what their result is
    Player payouts
    Win - add the amount bet to the player's balance
    Tie - neither add nor subtract from he player's balance
    Lose - subtract the amount bet from the player's balance
    Display each user's balance (including those who have lost all their money)
    Ask to Play again
    Yes: Repeat the round for all players with a positive balance
    No
    Print a Thank You message
    Print each player's name (their player number) and balance starting with the one with the highest. You should perform a sort first.
    Notes:

    This is not quite real blackjack.
    The player and dealer will not automatically win if they have Blackjack (21 on the first hand)
    There is no doubling down or insurance
    Card values
    Numeric cards are worth the same number of points
    Ace is worth eleven points unless the total of all cards exceeds 21, then it is counted as one.
    Jack, Queen, and King are worth 10 points
    Use the full card name, not the nickname for this task
    Use a single multidimensional list to manage the hands for all players and the dealer
    Use other appropriate list(s) to manage the account balance for each player and wagers
    Use appropriate prompts so it is clear which player should be playing and what their options are
    Use appropriate messages so players know what is happening in the game
    You should not modify the card or deck files

System design
     # Create variables and lists

        # Create a loop to validate and get the playerCount

            # Ask the user how many players there are in the game (1-5)

        # Initialize one list per player including the dealer

        # Add the starting money to each player except the dealer

        # Begin the play again loop

            # Initialize the deck

            # Add the bet list to the players

            # Add the handscore lists to the players including the dealer

            # Give each player their cards including the dealer
                    # Create two for loops to realistically divy out the cards

            # Calculate players scores

            # Calculate the dealers score

            # Ask and validate each players bet amount
                # Allow player to bet less than 5 if their cash total is less than 5

                # Validate betAmount
                    # Ask for the user for the bet amount

            # Show each player their stats

                # Create a loop to draw cards
                    # Validate and redefine hitStay
                        # Ask the player if they would like to hit or stay
                    # Add a card to the players hand if they hit
                        # Add the new card score to the score count
                        # If they draw a card and go over 21 then break
                    # Break if the player wants to stay

            # Show the dealers entire hand

            # Calculate the winners, tiers, losers
                # If they win
                    # Add the bet amount to the total cash
                    # Reset the bet amount
                # If they tie
                    # Reset the bet amount

                # If they lose
                    # Subtract the bet amount to the total cash
                    # Reset the bet amount
                    # Calculate if the player is out of the game

            # Ask the user if they would like to play again
