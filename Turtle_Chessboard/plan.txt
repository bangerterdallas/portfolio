Requirement Specifications
    Submit three files: plan.txt, chessboard.py, and assn10.py
    plan.txt is the text file for how the assignments are to be done or the requirement specifications
    chessboard.py is the file to create the modules for each box
    assn10.py is the file where the user gives input and the actual chessboard is created with turtle.py
        5 pts: SoftwareDevelopment Lifecycle Plan. Create a new file called plan.txt in PyCharm to type this in.
        5 pts: Get input properly from users. You may assume the users give valid input
        5 pts: main() is the only function defined in assn10.py, which also calls main()
        10 pts: Create a module called chessboard.py.
        -This contains all of the functions associated with drawing the board
        10 pts: Define drawChessboard() with appropriate parameters
        -This should draw the board outline, then call drawAllRectangles()
        15 pts: Define drawAllRectangles() with appropriate parameters
        -This should handle drawing all of the black rectangles by calling drawRectangle()
        --NOTE: It may be easiest to call this function twice, but not required
        15 pts: Define drawRectangle() with appropriate parameters
        -This should draw a single black rectangle (This will be called many times by a loop!)
        10 pts: A grid of 8x8 rectangles is properly drawn with alternating black/whites rectangles
        -Really this means to draw the black rectangles
        20 pts: Proper output for any location, height and width values
        -Height and width can be different and can be blank (then use default)
        --Note: The location should be the bottom-left corner of the chessboard
        5 pts: Follow proper coding conventions

System Design
    chessboard.py-
        #Create a function if the User does not give chessboard size
            #Assign width and height if neither height and width are given
            #Assign height if it is not given
            #assign width if it is not given
        #Create a function that will draw the chessboard outline
            #Go to the X,Y position to draw the outline
            #Begin draw and repeat strait length then rotate and straight height length then rotate
        #Create a function that will print all boxes on the chessboard
            #Repeat the draw (tip Mr. Mano suggested)
            #Move turtle to next row to draw 4 more squares
            #Move turtle over to draw the next square on  a row
            #Draw rectangle

    assn10.py-
    create and define the main() funciton
        import turtle
        Have the User give the starting position for the chessboard
        Have User give the width and height of the chessboard
        Use the chessboardSizeReassignment function to assign width and height if they did not give such values
        use the chessboardOutline function to draw the outline of the chessboard
        Use the printAllRectangle function to print the chessboard squares
    call the main() function

Testing
    TEST 1:
        x,y = (-250,-100)
        width = "", ""

    TEST 2
        x,y = (0,0)
        width = -100, -100
