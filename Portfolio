This portfolio contains all of my work and passion projects during my time at 
University. Each school based project will include an 'Experience_Gained' portion 
informing employers the breadth of skills that are known and how they have been 
implimented. This has been done to simplify the portfolio analysis for employers
as it would be unrealistic for someone to test every piece of code that I have
available.
