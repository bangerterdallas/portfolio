SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT
Requirement specs-
Create a password checker that follows the following parameters:
    Longer than 8 characters
    Does not contain 123
    Contains letters and numbers
    Does not have any special characters

System Analysis
    No formulas

System Design
    # Tell the user what the password parameters are
    # Create a loop until the user enters a password that satisfies the parameters
    # ask the user for the desired password
    # Run the class
        #Create constructor
        # Create useless method to set the password
        # Create method to check the length to be used later in isValid
        # Create method to check integer count to be used later in isValid
        # Create method to check letter count to be used later in isValid
        # Create method to check special characters to be used later in isValid
        # check if the password is valid
        # check the length of the password
        # Check to see if it contains at least two numbers
        # Check to see if it contains at least one letter
        # Check to see if it contains any special characters
        # If the message is blank the password is correct so the password is valid (True)
        # Print the error messages telling the user what is wrong with their password
    #Break the loop if password meets required parameters
