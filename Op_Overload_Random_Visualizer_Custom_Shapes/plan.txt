SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT PROCESS
Requirements Specification
    Create a program where a user can add and remove circles/rectangles to a list that you can remove specefic
        objects from and can draw the objects using turtle that have colors and positions
    5 pts: Proper display of all menus and input prompts
    10 pts: User can create a circle object with proper content
    10 pts: User can create a rectangle object with proper content
    10 pts: Show menu and allow user to remove a shape
    10 pts: All shapes drawn properly (location, size, color)
    10 pts: Use a single list for all objects
    5 pts: List to identify the color

System Design
    # Create function
    #define variables and objects
    # Create a loop
      # Create user menu
        # Create menu for circle
            # User inputs position, radius, and color. The position is the CENTER of the circle
            # Allow red, yellow, blue, and green only
            # Make sure that the color fits parameters
            # Use the class
            # Add the object to the list
        # Create menu for rectangle
            # User inputs position, height, width, color. The position is the lower left-hand corner
            # Allow red, yellow, blue, and green only
            # Make sure that the color fits parameters
            # Use the class
            # Add the object to the list
        # Show the number of items in the list and let the user enter a number and remove that shape from the list.
            # Show the list
            # Ask the user to remove an object from the list
            # Use pop to remove object from the list
            # Clear the screen before drawing
        # Exit the program

Testing
    Create a circle and a rectangle that fit all parameters
    PASSES

    Create two circles and rectangles that dont fit all parameters (color)
        ERROR- needed to fix the draw as I had seperate method names for drawing
